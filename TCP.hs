-- $client-side
--
-- The following functions allow you to obtain and use 'NS.Socket's useful to
-- the client side of a TCP connection.
--
-- Here's how you could run a TCP client:
--
-- > connect "www.example.org" "80" $ \(connectionSocket, remoteAddr) -> do
-- >   putStrLn $ "Connection established to " ++ show remoteAddr
-- >   -- now you may use connectionSocket as you please within this scope,
-- >   -- possibly with any of the socketReadS, nsocketReadS or socketWriteD
-- >   -- proxies explained below.

-- | Connect to a TCP server and use the connection.
--
-- The connection socket is closed when done or in case of exceptions.
--
-- If you prefer to acquire and close the socket yourself, then use
-- 'connectSock' and the 'NS.sClose' function from "Network.Socket" instead.

-- $server-side
--
-- The following functions allow you to obtain and use 'NS.Socket's useful to
-- the server side of a TCP connection.
--
-- Here's how you could run a TCP server that handles in different threads each
-- incoming connection to port @8000@ at address @127.0.0.1@:
--
-- > listen (Host "127.0.0.1") "8000" $ \(listeningSocket, listeningAddr) -> do
-- >   putStrLn $ "Listening for incoming connections at " ++ show listeningAddr
-- >   forever . acceptFork listeningSocket $ \(connectionSocket, remoteAddr) -> do
-- >     putStrLn $ "Connection established from " ++ show remoteAddr
-- >     -- now you may use connectionSocket as you please within this scope,
-- >     -- possibly with any of the socketReadS, nsocketReadS or socketWriteD
-- >     -- proxies explained below.
--
-- If you keep reading you'll discover there are different ways to achieve
-- the same, some ways more general than others. The above one was just an
-- example using a pretty general approach, you are encouraged to use simpler
-- approaches such as 'serve' if those suit your needs.

-- | Bind a TCP listening socket and use it.

--
-- If you prefer to acquire and close the socket yourself, then use
-- 'bindSock' and the 'NS.listen' and 'NS.sClose' functions from
-- "Network.Socket" instead.
--
-- Note: 'N.maxListenQueue' is tipically 128, which is too small for high
-- performance servers. So, we use the maximum between 'N.maxListenQueue' and
-- 2048 as the default size of the listening queue.
